# QHack-Quantum-Machine-Learning-Hackathon

The hackathon was on in April of 2021. We took part as a team of 4. All of us were part of the QubitxQubit Quantum Computing Course.  
The hackathon consisted of getting different types of challenges that needed to be solved using quantum computers.  
The module used for the challenges was Qiskit in Python. Points were only awarded if the solution was correct and passed a certain speed threshold.
